# SPH in Unity

Personal project to implement realtime fluid simulation in Unity with the use of the smooth particle hydrodynamic algorithm. First I will begin by coding and testing in C# and with compute shaders. 
After that a goal of mine would be to translate that into Lua.

## Why this project?

I have created many immersive environments in Unity and have wanted an efficient way to depict accurate fluid inside of containers. Additionally, I have completed multiple prior projects that utilized particle simulation.
I will be following in the footsteps of AJTech, who created an amazing video that also inspired me to begin this project!

## Goals
- Learn how to implement the SPH algorithm into a Unity project
- Represent a fluid with discrete, generated particles
- Learn the algorithm enough to explain it thoroughly
